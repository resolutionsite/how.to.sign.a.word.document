There are two significant steps to sign a Word document. First, we need to create or insert a signature line in the document. Second, you or the target user can add a signature on the signature line in the document. Though it sounds complicated, it is pretty easy to do. Here is how.

1. First, open the Word document you want to sign. Ensure the document is fully ready and requires no more editing or changes. Once you sign the document, you cannot edit it without invalidating the signature.

2. In the document, place the cursor where you want to insert the signature. In my case, I want to add it to the bottom left of the page.

3. Next, go to the “Insert” tab.

4. Click on the “Signature Line” dropdown menu and select the “Microsoft Office Signature Line” option.

5. The above action will open the Signature Setup window. Here, fill in the following fields.

            * Suggested signer: Who should sign the document.
            * Suggested signer’s title: What is the title of the person signing the document.
            * Signer’s email address: Signer’s email address.
            * Instructions for the signer: Any special instructions you need to tell the person signing the document.

6. Select the “Show sign date in signature line” checkbox. If you want to allow the signer to add their own comments to the signature, select the “Allow the signer to add comments in the Sign dialog” checkbox.

7. After filling the fields, click the “Ok” button to save changes in the Signature Setup window.

8. As soon as you click the Ok button, the signature line is added to the document. You can sign the document yourself or send it to the user who needs to sign it.

9. Double-click on the signature line or right-click on it and select the “Sign” option to sign the document.

10. In the Sign window, type your signature in the big box. If you have your signature in image format, click on the “Select image” button, select the image, and add it.

11. If you want to add additional information, like full name, address, etc., to your signature, then click on the “Details” button and add those details.
